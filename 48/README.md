## Homework (Code)

In this section, weâ€™ll write some simple communication code to get you familiar with the task of doing so. Have fun!

### Questions

1. Using the code provided in the chapter, build a simple UDP-based server and client. The server should receive messages from the client, and reply with an acknowledgment. In this first attempt, do not add any retransmission or robustness (assume that communication works perfectly). Run this on a single machine for testing; later, run it on two different machines.

2. Turn your code into a **communication library**. Specifically, make your own API, with send and receive calls, as well as other API calls as needed. Rewrite your client and server to use your library instead of raw socket calls.
