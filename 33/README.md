# Event-based Concurrency (Advanced)

## Homework (Code)

In this (short) homework, you’ll gain some experience with event-based code and some of its key concepts. Good luck!

### Questions

1. First, write a simple server that can accept and serve TCP connections. You’ll have to poke around the Internet a bit if you don’t already know how to do this. Build this to serve exactly one request at a time; have each request be very simple, e.g., to get the current time of day.
